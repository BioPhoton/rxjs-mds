# Colors

All colors are are barrier free  and used for specific things in the diagram.

There are 3 fixed colors and 4 to n colors that are free to choose. 

Colors name and usage: 
- **Line**  
For Text, lines, and arrows the “line” color is used.
- **Background**  
The `Background` color is not only used for the background but also for text to get an acceptable color ratio.
- **Inactive**  
The `Inactive` color is used for anything that should be recognized as inactive.
- **Value1**  
Value color 1  
For `Value` colors you can use the defined colors 1 - 4 or any other color of your choice. 
All value colors have the same meaning. There is no “danger” or “success” color.  
- **Value2**  
`Value` color 2
- **Value3**  
`Value` color 3
- **Value4**  
`Value` color 4  

Colors serve the purpose to distinguish between values or observables.

Try to use as less colors as possible to keep the visual noise of a marble diagram low.  

If you create your own color patterns keep in mind that you can use text inside shapes.

Also always check your palette including text with a color contrast tool like accessible-color-matrix
