The design guide doesnâ€™t limit the choice of font.

Only a few limitations are suggested.

Serif font-face and mono-space letter.

**Serif Font-Face**
Serif font-face has compared the serif font-faces less visual noise.
 
**Mono-space**
Mono-space font has to be used in the description of observables, operators or in the text of values.
This ensures that the with of text is directly proportional to the number of characters and therefore simplifies the positioning and alignment of text in diagrams.
