Shape, same as color helps to distinguish between values. 
You can use the suggested set or create your own set of shapes.

Try to use as less different shapes as possible to keep the visual noise of a marble diagram low.

Also consider that every shape should be able to have dynamic with. (dynamic in number of blocks)
